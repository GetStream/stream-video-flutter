In this guide, we will cover the basics of making your first call using Stream Video. If you havenâ€™t already, we recommend starting with the **************************introduction************************** and **************************installation************************** steps first as this guide will build on the material covered in those sections. 

### Client setup

Before we can create a new video client, we must first import the Stream Video package into our application. 

```dart
import 'package:stream_video_flutter/stream_video_flutter.dart'; 
```

Next, in our applicationâ€™s `main` function, we can initialize the application by calling the `init` function and giving it our API key:

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Add to your application
  StreamVideo.init(
    Env.streamVideoApiKey,
  );

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: Because we initialize before the `runApp` method is called, it is important to call `WidgetsFlutterBinding` first.
