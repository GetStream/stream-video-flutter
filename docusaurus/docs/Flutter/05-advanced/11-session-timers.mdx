A session timer allows you to limit the maximum duration of a call. The duration [can be configured](https://getstream.io/video/docs/api/calls/#session-timers) for all calls of a certain type, or on a per-call basis. When a session timer reaches zero, the call automatically ends.

## Creating a call with a session timer

Let's see how to create a single call with a limited duration:

```dart
final call = client.makeCall(callType: StreamCallType.defaultType(), id: 'REPLACE_WITH_CALL_ID');
await call.getOrCreate(
  limits: const StreamLimitsSettings(
    maxDurationSeconds: 3600,
  ),
);
```

This code creates a call with a duration of 3600 seconds (1 hour) from the time the session is starts (a participant joins the call).

After joining the call with the specified `maxDurationSeconds`, you can examine a call state's `timerEndsAt` field, which provides the timestamp when the call will end. When a call ends, all participants are removed from the call.

```dart
await call.join();
print(call.state.value.timerEndsAt);
```

## Extending a call

â€‹You can also extend the duration of a call, both before or during the call. To do that, you should use the `call.update` method:

```dart
final duration =
    call.state.value.settings.limits.maxDurationSeconds! + 60;
    
call.update(
  limits: StreamLimitsSettings(
    maxDurationSeconds: duration,
  ),
);
```

If the call duration is extended, the `timerEndsAt` is updated to reflect this change. Call participants will receive the `call.updated` event to notify them about this change.
