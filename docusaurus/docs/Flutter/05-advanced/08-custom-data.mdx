description: Learn how to add and read custom data in the Stream Video Flutter SDK.
---

Custom data is additional information that can be added to the default data of Stream. It is a dictionary of key-value pairs that can be attached to users, events, and pretty much almost every domain model in the Stream SDK.

In the SDK, custom data is represented by the `Map<String, Object>`. This means that the key must be a string and the value can be any object.

## Adding Custom Data

Adding extra data can be done through the Server-Side SDKs or through the Client SDKs. In the Flutter Stream Video SDK, you can add extra data when creating/updating a call, updating a user and sending event or reaction.

###### Example of updating the call custom data

```dart
call.update(custom: {'mycustomfield': 'mycustomvalue'});
```

###### Example of sending a reaction with custom data

```dart
call.sendReaction(
  reactionType: 'raise-hand',
  emojiCode: ':smile:',
  custom: {'mycustomfield': 'mycustomvalue'},
);
```

###### Example of sending a custom event with custom data

```dart
call.sendCustomEvent(
  eventType: 'my-custom-event',
  custom: {'mycustomfield': 'mycustomvalue'},
);
```

###### Example of updating the user custom data while initializing the StreamVideo

```dart
StreamVideo(
  apiKey,
  user: User.regular(userId: 'userId', extraData: {'mycustomfield': 'mycustomvalue'}),
  userToken: token,
);
```

## Reading Custom Data
â€‹
Reading the custom data is as simple as accessing the `custom` field of the object. For example, to read the custom data of a reaction, you can access the `custom` field of the reaction event object.

```dart
call.callEvents.listen((event) {
  if (event is StreamCallReactionEvent) {
    final customData = event.custom;
  }
});
```

For `Call` object the custom data is stored in call metadata that can be accessed when calling `getOrCreate()` or `get()` method.

```dart
final result = await call.getOrCreate();
final customData = result.fold(
   success: (success) => success.data.data.metadata.details.custom,
   failure: (_) => null,
);

//or

final result = await call.get();
final customData = result.fold(
   success: (success) => success.data.metadata.details.custom,
   failure: (_) => null,
);
```
