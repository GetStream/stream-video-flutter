You can take a picture of a VideoTrack at highest possible resolution. This can be useful for example if you want to take a screenshot of a screenshare at full resolution.

```dart
final participant = call.state.value.otherParticipants.first;
final screenshot = call.takeScreenshot(participant);
```

In case you want to take a screenshot of a screen-sharing track, you can specify which track type you want to capture:

```dart
final participant = call.state.value.otherParticipants.first;
final screenshot = call.takeScreenshot(participant, trackType: SfuTrackType.screenShare);
```
