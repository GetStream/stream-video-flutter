# Transcriptions

Enabling your application to provide a transcript for a call can be very useful for your users. We understand though, that this can be a difficult feature to implement/support.

This is why, the Flutter Video SDK comes with out of the box Transcription support that you can easily manage.

First thing you can do is access the transcriptions settings as they have been configured from the dashboard. The `mode` property defines the feature's availability with:

- `available`: the feature is available for your call and can be enabled.

- `disabled`: the feature is not available for your call. In this case, it's a good idea to "hide" any UI element you have related to transcription.

- `autoOn`: the feature is available and it will be enabled automatically, once the user is connected on the call.

Second thing you can do is to start/stop the transcription itself. This can be done by calling the `call.startTranscription()` and `call.stopTranscription()` methods.

Transcription file is saved whenever you stop the transcription or end the call. You can then access the transcription files by calling the `call.listTranscriptions()` method.
