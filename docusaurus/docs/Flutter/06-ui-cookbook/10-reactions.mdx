# Reactions

Reactions in video calls add a layer of nonverbal communication, adding engagement and enhancing
the overall experience. They are a great way for users to communicate even when on mute.

// Add photo for reactions

The Flutter SDK for Stream Video has inbuilt support for displaying reactions as well as reaction
controls to add reactions for a user.

## Reaction Control

The `AddReactionOption` is the call control responsible for adding reactions to a video call.

// Add photo of the add reaction option

You can add the control to your control bar by customising the `StreamCallControls` widget:

```dart
StreamCallContent(
    call: call,
    callState: state,
    callControlsBuilder: (context, call, state) {
    return StreamCallControls(
      options: [
        ...defaultCallControlOptions(
          call: call,
          localParticipant: state.localParticipant!,
        ),
        AddReactionOption(
          call: call,
          localParticipant: state.localParticipant!,
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
)
```

This reaction shows up on the participant video on the upper right hand corner:

// Add photo for reaction on participant

## Customising Reactions

The default reactions supplied by the SDK are `like`, `raised-hand`, and `fireworks`. However, you can
replace these with your own reactions via the `CallControlsTheme`:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    textTheme: GoogleFonts.robotoMonoTextTheme(),
    extensions: <ThemeExtension<dynamic>>[
      lightAppTheme.copyWith(
        callControlsTheme: StreamCallControlsThemeData(
          callReactions: [
            CallReactionData(
              type: 'reaction',
              emojiCode: ':like:',
              icon: 'üëç',
            ),
            CallReactionData(
              type: 'raised-hand',
              emojiCode: ':raise-hand:',
              icon: '‚úã',
            ),
            CallReactionData(
              type: 'reaction',
              emojiCode: ':fireworks:',
              icon: 'üéâ',
            ),
            // Add your reaction here
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  // ...
);
```
