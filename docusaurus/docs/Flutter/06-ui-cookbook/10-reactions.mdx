# Reactions

Reactions in video calls add a layer of nonverbal communication, adding engagement and enhancing
the overall experience. They are a great way for users to communicate even when on mute.

The Flutter SDK for Stream Video has inbuilt support for displaying reactions as well as reaction
controls to add reactions for a user.

## Reaction Control

The `AddReactionOption` is the call control responsible for adding reactions to a video call.

You can add the control to your control bar by customising the `StreamCallControls` widget:

```dart
StreamCallContent(
    call: call,
    callState: state,
    callControlsBuilder: (context, call, state) {
    return StreamCallControls(
      options: [
        ...defaultCallControlOptions(
          call: call,
          localParticipant: state.localParticipant!,
        ),
        AddReactionOption(
          call: call,
          localParticipant: state.localParticipant!,
        ),
      ],
    );
  },
)
```

## Customising Reactions

The default reactions supplied by the SDK are `like`, `raised-hand`, and `fireworks`. However, you can
replace these with your own reactions via the `CallControlsTheme`:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    textTheme: GoogleFonts.robotoMonoTextTheme(),
    extensions: <ThemeExtension<dynamic>>[
      lightAppTheme.copyWith(
        callControlsTheme: StreamCallControlsThemeData(
          callReactions: [
            CallReactionData(
              type: 'reaction',
              emojiCode: ':like:',
              icon: 'üëç',
            ),
            CallReactionData(
              type: 'raised-hand',
              emojiCode: ':raise-hand:',
              icon: '‚úã',
            ),
            CallReactionData(
              type: 'reaction',
              emojiCode: ':fireworks:',
              icon: 'üéâ',
            ),
            // Add your reaction here
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
  // ...
);
```
