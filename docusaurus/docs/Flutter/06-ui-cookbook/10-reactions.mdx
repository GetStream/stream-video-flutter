# Reactions

Reactions in video calls add a layer of nonverbal communication, adding engagement and enhancing
the overall experience. They are a great way for users to communicate even when on mute.

// Add photo for reactions

The Flutter SDK for Stream Video has inbuilt support for displaying reactions as well as reaction
controls to add reactions for a user.

## Reaction Control

The `AddReactionOption` is the call control responsible for adding reactions to a video call.

// Add photo of the add reaction option

You can add the control to your control bar by customising the `StreamCallControls` widget:

// Add code for reaction control customisation

This reaction shows up on the participant video on the upper right hand corner:

// Add photo for reaction on participant

## Customising Reactions

The default reactions supplied by the SDK are `like`, `raised-hand`, and `fireworks`. However, you can
replace these with your own reactions via the `CallControlsTheme`:

// Add code for adding your own reactions
