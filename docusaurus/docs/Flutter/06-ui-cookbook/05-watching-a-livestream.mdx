# Watching a Livestream

This sample walks you through building advanced UIs for watching a livestream on Flutter.

:::note
In this cookbook tutorial, we will assume that you already know how to join a livestream call. If you haven't familiarized yourself with the **[Livestream Tutorial](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/livestreaming/)** yet, we highly recommend doing so before proceeding with this cookbook.

To view an HLS stream and benefit from the full experience of selecting different streaming qualities and performing different player actions like muting and unmuting the stream, we recommend using [lecle_yoyo_player](https://pub.dev/packages/lecle_yoyo_player).

When building for livestreaming, there are a few considerations you need to keep in mind for the UI:

- UI for when the video isn't loaded yet
- A message to show when the livestream hasn't started yet
- What to show when the livestream stopped
- How to indicate when there are connection problems
- Number of participants
- Duration of the call

## Setting up the UI
To setup our UI for rendering a livestream, we can use Flutterâ€™s built-in `StreamBuilder` widget for listening to changes in our call state and rendering different UIs based on the stage of our live stream:

```dart
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SafeArea(
      child: StreamBuilder(
        stream: widget.call.state.valueStream,
        initialData: widget.call.state.value,
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          final callState = snapshot.data!;
          return Stack(
            children: [
              if (snapshot.hasData && !callState.isBackstage)
								// TODO: Render Video

              if (snapshot.hasData && !callState.isBackstage)
							 // TODO: Render Participant Count

              if (!snapshot.hasData)
								// TODO: Render loading indicator

              if (snapshot.hasData && callState.isBackstage)
							 // TODO: Display message call is not live

            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

By looking at different properties on our `CallState`, we can render different UIs and messages based on whether the call is live, backstage, or loading. A `Stack` also allows us to add different secondary live stream elements such as a view count above the main UI.

## Rendering the Livestream
Before running the code below to see the livestream in action, we recommend going to our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.getstream.io/) and creating a livestream first since it can be done visually without having to create another instance of the application on the simulator.

Once a stream is started on the dashboard, the `Livestream ID` can be passed to the `id` parameter for the `Call` object in code.

```dart
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SafeArea(
      child: StreamBuilder(
        stream: widget.call.state.valueStream,
        initialData: widget.call.state.value,
        builder: (context, snapshot) {
          final callState = snapshot.data!;
          return Stack(
            children: [
              if (snapshot.hasData && !callState.isBackstage)
                _buildRender(callState),
              if (snapshot.hasData && !callState.isBackstage)
                Positioned(
                  top: 12.0,
                  left: 12.0,
                  child: Material(
                    shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(
                      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(24),
                    ),
                    color: Colors.red,
                    child: Center(
                      child: Padding(
                        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                        child: Text(
                          'Viewers: ${callState.callParticipants.length - 1}',
                          style: const TextStyle(
                            fontSize: 14,
                            color: Colors.white,
                            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                          ),
                        ),
                      ),
                    ),
                  ),
                ),
              if (snapshot.hasData && (callState.isBackstage))
                const Material(
                  child: Center(
                    child: Text('Stream not live'),
                  ),
                ),
              if (!snapshot.hasData)
                const Center(
                  child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
                ),
            ],
          );
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
