# Call Lobby

Call lobbies pre-stage participants, allowing device checks and fostering a sense of anticipation,
leading to smoother and more focused video meetings. With Stream Video you can create a video experience
with or without a call lobby.

## Adding a call lobby in your call flow

The Flutter SDK for Stream Video provides an inbuilt `StreamLobbyView` widget which makes it effortless to
incorporate a lobby into your video flow.

The inbuilt widget contains a variety of things required for a call lobby: a preview of the user's video,
controls for video and audio, the users already in the call, and of course, a join call button.

To do this, first create a call with the appropriate details and pass it along to the `StreamLobbyView` widget:

```dart
final call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(callType: StreamCallType.defaultType(), id: callId);

StreamLobbyView(
  call: call,
  onJoinCallPressed: (options) {
    // Navigate to your call screen
  },
),
```
