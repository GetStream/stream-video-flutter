### Create a new project

Let's begin by creating a new Flutter project and adding the `stream_video_flutter` package to the project.

```bash
flutter create audio_example --empty

cd audio_example

flutter pub add stream_video_flutter

```

Next, you can create a project on Streamâ€™s dashboard to obtain an API key for your project.

For detailed instructions on how to create a project on the Stream Dashboard, please see our [blog post](https://getstream.io/blog/registering-for-stream-chat/).

### Setting up the client

First, let's import the package into the project we created earlier:

```dart
import 'package:stream_video_flutter/stream_video_flutter.dart';

```

Next, we can configure the Stream client and create a room for our call:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter is able to communicate with Plugins
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize Stream video and set the API key for our app.
  StreamVideo.init('YOUR-API-KEY', logPriority: Priority.info);

  // Connect a user by calling to our application
  await StreamVideo.instance.connectUser(
    const UserInfo(id: 'testing', role: 'admin', name: 'Test User'),
    'YOUR-TOKEN',
  );

  // Set up our call object
  final call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(type: 'livestream', id: 'first_room');
  // Connect to the call we created
  await call.getOrCreateCall();

  runApp(
    StreamVideoGettingStarted(
      call: call,
    ),
  );
}

```

In the example above, we did not specify it but `getOrCreateCall` does allow for the creator to pass in a list of member IDs during creation. These can represent co-hosts of the room during creation.

### Recap

In just a few minutes, we were able to create our first livestreaming experience for our app. Please let us know if you ran into any issues during the process. Our team constantly reviews feedback and applies changes to improve the overall experience.

This is just a small example of what's possible with Stream and livestreaming.

We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and look forward to hearing your suggestions and feedback.
