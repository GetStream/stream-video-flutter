### Introduction
In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a video calling app similar to Google Meet or Zoom using Stream Video.

### Creating a new project on the dashboard
To start with, log in to the Stream dashboard and create a new project for your new video calling app.

You will need to fill in the relevant fields, like this:

![Create Project](../assets/tutorials/vc-create-project.png)

Once the project is created, navigate to the *Video&Audio* section. Note your API key from the overview:

![Stream Video Key](../assets/tutorials/vc-key.png)

### Creating a new Flutter project and adding configuration

To begin developing your video calling app, you need to create a new Flutter project.
If you do not have Flutter or an IDE configured to work with it, we highly recommend following the [Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
and [Set up an editor](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor) steps from the official documentation.

Please make sure you are using the latest version of Flutter from the stable channel:

```bash
flutter channel stable
flutter upgrade
```

Now, open your IDE and start a new Flutter application called flutter_video_calling_demo.
If you are using Android Studio (recommended) make sure to create the project as a Flutter application
and keep all default settings.

The next step is to add Stream Video to your dependencies, to do that just open pubspec.yaml
and add it inside the dependencies section.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  stream_video: ^0.0.2
  stream_video_flutter: ^0.0.2
  stream_video_push_notification: ^0.0.2
```

Stream has several packages that you can use to integrate video into your application.

In this tutorial, we will use the [stream_video_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_video_flutter) package which contains pre-built UI elements for you to use.

You can also use the [stream_video](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_video) package directly if you need direct access to the low-level client.

The [stream_video_flutter_background] package adds background capabilities for the app on Android while the
[stream_video_push_notification] package helps in adding push notifications and an end-to-end call flow (CallKit).

### Initialising Stream Video

To start adding the SDK to your app, initialise the Stream Video SDK with a user:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_video_flutter/stream_video_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  final client = StreamVideo(
    'hd8szvscpxvd',
    user: User.regular(userId: 'vasil', role: 'admin', name: 'Willard Hessel'),
    userToken: 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoidmFzaWwifQ.N44i27-o800njeSlcvH2HGlBfTl8MH4vQl0ddkq5BVI',
  );

  // Right after creation client connects to the backend and authenticates the user
  // To access the client you can simply use `StreamVideo.instance`.

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

:::note
Connecting a user usually takes places after authentication and token creation originating from your backend.
This example uses a demo token for the user.
:::

Your user is now connected.

Before you go ahead, you need to add the required permissions for video calling to your app.

In your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, add these permissions:

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" android:maxSdkVersion="30"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>

    ...
</manifest>
```

For the corresponding iOS permissions, open the `Info.plist` file and add:

```plist
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Camera Usage!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Microphone Usage!</string>
<key>UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents</key>
<true/>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>audio</string>
	<string>fetch</string>
	<string>processing</string>
	<string>remote-notification</string>
	<string>voip</string>
</array>
```

### Setting up a call

Now that the dependencies, permissions, and initialisations are set, we can get onto creating a call.

Let's create a simple screen with a button that joins a call:

```dart
return Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.inversePrimary,
    title: Text(widget.title),
  ),
  body: Center(
   child: ElevatedButton(
     child: Text('Create Call'),
     onPressed: () async {

     },
   ),
  ),
);
```

To instantiate a call, you can use the `StreamVideo.makeCall()` method. You then need to create this
on the backend using the `call.getOrCreate()` method.

Here is how that looks in code:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  child: Text('Create Call'),
  onPressed: () async {
    try {
      var call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(
          type: 'default', id: 'demo-call-123');

      await call.getOrCreate();
    } catch (e) {
      debugPrint('Error joining or creating call: $e');
      debugPrint(e.toString());
    }
  },
)
```

The UI as of the moment is a simple button on the screen:

![Home Screen UI](../assets/tutorials/vc-ui-1.png)

You have created a Stream Video call. Let's set up the call screen UI so that the user can see other users
and interact.

### Setting up the call UI

To set up a call screen, set up a new file named 'call_screen.dart' and create a new widget to handle the call screen:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:stream_video_flutter/stream_video_flutter.dart';

class CallScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final Call call;

  const CallScreen({
    Key? key,
    required this.call,
  }) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<CallScreen> createState() => _CallScreenState();
}

class _CallScreenState extends State<CallScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Placeholder();
  }
}
```

In this widget, we take the call we created previously as a parameter.

In the `build()` method, we use the `StreamCallContainer` widget - a widget made by the Stream team to
make it easy to build video calls:

```dart
class _CallScreenState extends State<CallScreen> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: StreamCallContainer(
        call: widget.call,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

And that's... pretty much it.

Once you navigate to the `CallScreen` after the button press, this is what you will be greeted with:

![Call Screen UI](../assets/tutorials/vc-ui-2.png)

:::note
When connecting other users, you can use the same process. The `call.getOrCreate()` method will create
a call if it doesn't exist, and simply return the existing call if it already does.
:::

### Customising the `StreamCallContainer`

To customise any aspect of the call screen made previously, you can use the `CallContentBuilder` parameter
of the `StreamCallContainer`.

For example, if you want to add your own call controls to the call, you can do it using the `callControlsBuilder`:

```dart
StreamCallContainer(
  call: widget.call,
  callContentBuilder: (
      BuildContext context,
      Call call,
      CallState callState,
      ) {
    return StreamCallContent(
      call: call,
      callState: callState,
      callControlsBuilder: (
          BuildContext context,
          Call call,
          CallState callState,
          ) {
        final localParticipant = callState.localParticipant!;
        return StreamCallControls(
          options: [
            CallControlOption(
              icon: const Icon(Icons.chat_outlined),
              onPressed: () {
                // Open your chat window
              },
            ),
            FlipCameraOption(
              call: call,
              localParticipant: localParticipant,
            ),
            AddReactionOption(
              call: call,
              localParticipant: localParticipant,
            ),
            ToggleMicrophoneOption(
              call: call,
              localParticipant: localParticipant,
            ),
            ToggleCameraOption(
              call: call,
              localParticipant: localParticipant,
            ),
            LeaveCallOption(
              call: call,
              onLeaveCallTap: () {
                call.leave();
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  },
),
```

When building Whatsapp/Telegram style calling, you need to add incoming and outgoing screens to the app.
The `StreamCallContainer` also has these screens inbuilt and allows you to change these using the `incomingCallBuilder` and
`outgoingCallBuilder`.
