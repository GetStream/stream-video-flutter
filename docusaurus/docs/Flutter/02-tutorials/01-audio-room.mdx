In this tutorial, we will learn how to build an audio room experience similar to Twitter Spaces or Clubhouse using Stream Video.

Before we dive into the Audio Rooms APIs, there are a few fundamental things to understand:

- Backstage: When an `audio_room` call is created, it exists in backstage mode by default. This means that the call creator and co-hosts can chat with each other privately before the call is set live and others can join.
- All calls run on Stream's global edge network for improved latency and quality. When a user connects to a call, they connect to a server closest to their location. Stream further optimizes this in the background.
- There are no limits to the number of users you can have in a room.
- By default, listeners are muted and require speaking permission before they can send audio. The call host can grant this permission.
- Stream sends audio tracks multiple times for improved quality and reliability.

### Create a new project

Let's begin by creating a new Flutter project and adding the `stream_video_flutter` package to the project.

```bash
flutter create audio_example --empty

cd audio_example

flutter pub add stream_video_flutter

```

Next, you can create a project on Streamâ€™s dashboard to obtain an API key for your project.

For detailed instructions on how to create a project on the Stream Dashboard, please see our [blog post](https://getstream.io/blog/registering-for-stream-chat/).

### Setting up the client

First, let's import the package into the project we created earlier:

```dart
import 'package:stream_video_flutter/stream_video_flutter.dart';

```

Next, we can configure the Stream client and create a room for our call:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  // Ensure Flutter is able to communicate with Plugins
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Initialize Stream video and set the API key for our app.
  StreamVideo.init('YOUR-API-KEY', logPriority: Priority.info);

  // Connect a user by calling to our application
  await StreamVideo.instance.connectUser(
    const UserInfo(id: 'testing', role: 'admin', name: 'Test User'),
    'YOUR-TOKEN',
  );

  // Set up our call object
  final call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(type: 'audio_room', id: 'first_room');
  // Connect to the call we created
  await call.getOrCreateCall();

  runApp(
    StreamVideoGettingStarted(
      call: call,
    ),
  );
}

```

In the example above, we did not specify it but `getOrCreateCall` does allow for the creator to pass in a list of member IDs during creation. These can represent co-hosts of the room during creation.

### Recap

In just a few minutes, we were able to create our first audio-room experience for our app. Please let us know if you ran into any issues during the process. Our team constantly reviews feedback and applies changes to improve the overall experience.

This is just a small example of what's possible with Stream and audio. For more advanced use-cases like using OPUS DTX and OPUS RED, check out some of our other examples and guides on our website and GitHub.

We hope you enjoyed this tutorial and look forward to hearing your suggestions and feedback.
