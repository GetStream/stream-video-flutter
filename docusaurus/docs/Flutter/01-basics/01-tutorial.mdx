# Build a Flutter App with Video and Audio Calling with the Stream SDK

Welcome to this tutorial on adding the Stream Video SDK to your Flutter app.
Stream Video is a Video and Audio calling SDK that enables developers to create immersive video and
audio experiences that allow users to connect with each other in real-time.
Whether you are building a social app, a collaboration tool, or an e-learning platform,
the Stream Video SDK makes it easy to add reliable and high-quality video and audio communication to your app.

## Flutter Video SDK Setup

First of all we need to setup our new project and have a working development environment for Flutter.
If you do not have Flutter or an IDE configured to work with it, we highly recommend following the [Install]() and [Set up]() an editor steps from the official documentation.

Please make sure you are using the latest version of Flutter from the stable channel:

```dart
flutter channel stable
flutter upgrade
```

Now open your IDE and start a new Flutter application called awesome_flutter_video.
If you are using Android Studio (recommended) make sure to create the project as a Flutter application and keep all default settings.

Next step is to add stream_video_flutter to your dependencies, to do that just open `pubspec.yaml` and add it inside the dependencies section:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  stream_video_flutter: ^0.1.0
```
