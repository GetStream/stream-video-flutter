### Introduction

The Stream Video Flutter SDK provides UI components to facilitate the quick integration of voice, video, and streaming use cases in your applications.

As a developer building with Stream, you can either use our out-of-the-box solution, inclusive of theming, views, and state handling, or completely build your own UI while reusing our lower-level components where you see fit.

| Video Render      | StreamVideoRenderer       | Widget that renders a single video track for a call participant. StreamVideoRenderer exposes callbacks for handling size changes, video fit types, and more!                                                                                                                                                          |
| Call Container    | StreamCallContainer       | Call Container automatically subscribes to call events and displays the appropriate UI based on the various call states. For example, Call Container will automatically display an incoming call screen when a ringing call is detected and update the UI to display the call contents if the user chooses to answer. |
| Incoming Call     | StreamIncomingCallContent | Displays a ringing interface to the current user when an incoming call is detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Outgoing Call     | StreamOutgoingCallContent | Represents the UI of a call when the current user rings another user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Call Content      | StreamCallContent         | Represents the UI of an active call. This Widget displays the participants, controls, and call app bar by default.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Call Controls     | StreamCallControls        | These represent a set of options the user can interact with to control various aspects of the call such as toggling the microphone, camera, etc. For convenience, we provide a `withDefaultOptions` constructor.                                                                                                      |
| Call Participants | StreamCallParticipants    | StreamCallParticipants renders the participants on a call and adjusts itself based on the number of participants, screen-sharing, grid type, etc.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Lobby View        | StreamLobbyView           | A widget that can be shown before a user joins a meeting or call. It allows the user to configure their microphone, camera, and output device state before joining a call.                                                                                                                                            |
