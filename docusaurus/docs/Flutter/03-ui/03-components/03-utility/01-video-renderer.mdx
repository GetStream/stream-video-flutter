# StreamVideoRenderer

One of the main utility components we provide is `StreamVideoRenderer`. It's a simple widget, which utilizes `RTCVideoView` under the hood. It supports the rendering of both a user camera track and a screen sharing track.

Let's see how to use the widget in your UI.

## Usage

You can use the `StreamVideoRenderer` widget like this:

```dart
class CallParticipant extends StatelessWidget {
  const CallParticipant({
    super.key,
    required this.call,
    required this.participant,
  });

  final Call call;
  final CallParticipantState participant;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return StreamVideoRenderer(
      call: call,
      participant: participant,
      videoTrackType: SfuTrackType.video,
      placeholderBuilder: (context) {
        return Container(
          constraints: const BoxConstraints.expand(),
          color: Colors.black,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

In the snippet above, you create an instance of `StreamVideoRenderer` and pass the following parameters:

* `call`: Contains all the information about the call.
* `participant`: The participant who is publishing the track.
* `videoTrackType`: The type of video track to display.
* `placeholderBuilder`: The builder for a placeholder.

This code will generate a single video track based on what the user is currently using - a front, back or external camera.

## Choosing the SfuTrackTypeVideo

The `videoTrackType` parameter can have two possible values:

* `SfuTrackTypeVideo.video`: Represents the video of the participant, from their camera feed.
* `SfuTrackTypeVideo.screenShare`: Represents the screen sharing track of the participant, based on what screen or window they're sharing.

You can always determine if a person is screen sharing by checking if the `CallParticipantState.screenShareTrack` property is not null, or by checking if `participant.publishedTracks[SfuTrackTypeVideo.screenShare]` is not null.

## Resizing StreamVideoRenderer 

It makes sense to receive a video track with dimensions that roughly match the size of `StreamVideoRenderer` and adjust the video track subscription if the widget is resized. 

Fortunately enough, we provide this for you, out of the box. When `StreamVideoRenderer` is resized we make a request to the server to update the current subscription.
