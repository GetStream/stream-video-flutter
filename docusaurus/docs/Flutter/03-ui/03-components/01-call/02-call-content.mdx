# StreamCallContent

The StreamCallContent widget displays the ongoing call which includes the user grid, call controls,
`AppBar` with call information, and the local user. The widget can be used on its own or as a part of
`StreamCallContainer`.

## Usage

```dart
    StreamCallContent(
      call: call,
      callState: callState,
    ),
```

## Customisation

There are various aspects of the `StreamCallContent` widget that can be modified including the various
components that make up the screen as well as the actions available on the screen.

### Handling actions

You can provide a callback to run when the user presses the back button or leaves the call by providing
the `onBackPressed` and `onLeaveCallTap` respectively:

```dart
    StreamCallContent(
      call: call,
      callState: callState,
      onLeaveCallTap: () {},
      onBackPressed: () {},
    ),
```

### Customising the AppBar

You can use the `callAppBarBuilder` parameter to customise the existing `AppBar` or to provide an entirely
new one. To use and modify the `AppBar` that the SDK provides, you can use the `CallAppBar` widget:

```dart
    StreamCallContent(
      call: call,
      callState: callState,
      callAppBarBuilder: (context, call, callState) {
        return CallAppBar(
          call: call,
        );
      },
    ),
```

You can modify the `CallAppBar` to change styles, add/remove leading and trailing elements, as well as
change the information displayed on the bar. Here are a few properties you can change:

```dart
    StreamCallContent(
      call: call,
      callState: callState,
      callAppBarBuilder: (a, b, c) {
        return CallAppBar(
          call: call,
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          title: const Text('Demo title'),
          onParticipantsInfoTap: () {},
        );
      },
    ),
```

### Customising the users display

The default widget comes with a grid of call participants displayed at the center. If you want to modify
the properties of the grid or supply your own implementation, you can use the `callParticipantsBuilder` to
do it. To use the default grid, use the `StreamCallParticipants` widget:

```dart
    StreamCallContent(
      call: call,
      callState: callState,
      callParticipantsBuilder: (context, call, callState) {
        return StreamCallParticipants(
          call: call,
          participants: callState.callParticipants,
        );
      },
    ),
```

You can then change aspects of this grid such as changing the participants to display, changing the
individual participant view, changing actions, etc.

### Customising the call controls

The call controls are controls for the participant to modify their video and audio state, leave call,
share screen, etc. These can be changed via the `callControlsBuilder` parameter. The default controls
can be used by using the `StreamCallControls.withDefaultOptions()` widget constructor. You can then modify
aspects of this widget like this:

```dart
    StreamCallContent(
      call: call,
      callState: callState,
      callControlsBuilder: (context, call, callState) {
        return StreamCallControls.withDefaultOptions(
          call: call,
          localParticipant: callState.localParticipant!,
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue,
          elevation: 24.0,
          spacing: 4.0,
        );
      },
    ),
```
