# CallContainer

The `CallContainer` widget is an all-encompassing widget that can handle all stages of a call: incoming,
outgoing and active call screens. The individual screens also contain everything required to manage the call
such as call controls on the active call screen as well as accept and hang up buttons on the incoming and outgoing screens.

The `CallContainer` has three components:

1. Incoming Call: Shows an incoming call to the user with the options to accept or reject the call.
2. Outgoing Call: Shows the person being called by the user along with an end call button.
3. Active Call: Displays the active call with videos of participants and call controls which allow the user
to enable/disable audio and video, as well as leave the call. Also contains an `AppBar` which contains
basic info about the call along with the list of participants in the call available via a button.

## Usage

To use `CallContainer`, pass in the `Call` object you want to use for the call. Pass in a `CallConnectOptions`
object which determines if video, audio, and screen-share are enabled by default.


```dart
    final callConnectOptions = CallConnectOptions();

    StreamCallContainer(
        call: call,
        callConnectOptions: callConnectOptions,
    ),
```

This is how the screen flow looks:

* Incoming Call

// TODO: Add image

* Active Call

// TODO: Add image

* Outgoing Call

// TODO: Add image
