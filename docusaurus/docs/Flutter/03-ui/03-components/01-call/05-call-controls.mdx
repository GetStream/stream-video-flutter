# CallControls

The `CallControls` are controls for a call participant to modify their video and audio state, leave call,
share screen, etc.

## Usage

There are two ways to use the `StreamCallControls` widget. The first is to use the `StreamCallControls.withDefaultOptions()`
constructor which provides a default set of options. The second is to provide all the options to display
to the widget which can include any custom actions needed for your application.

Here are the two respective ways:

```dart
    StreamCallControls.withDefaultOptions(
      call: call,
      localParticipant: callState.localParticipant!,
    )
```

OR

```dart
    StreamCallControls(
      options: [
        // Custom action
        CallControlOption(
          icon: const Icon(Icons.chat_outlined),
          onPressed: () async {},
        ),
        // Predefined actions
        ToggleSpeakerphoneOption(call: call),
        ToggleMicrophoneOption(call: call, localParticipant: localParticipant),
        ToggleCameraOption(call: call, localParticipant: localParticipant),
        LeaveCallOption(
          call: call,
          onLeaveCallTap: () {
            call.end();
            call.disconnect();
          },
        ),
      ],
    ),
```

## Customisation

Both the `StreamCallControls` widget as well as the individual `CallControlOptions` can be customised
according to your app needs. This page focuses on customising the `StreamCallControls` package while
you can find more information on customising the `CallControlOption` widget on [this](// TODO: Add link) page.

### Adding a custom action

To add a custom action, you need to use the default constructor of the widget and provide the options
you want to display to the widget.

```dart
    StreamCallControls(
      options: [
        // Custom action
        CallControlOption(
          icon: const Icon(Icons.chat_outlined),
          onPressed: () async {},
        ),
        // Add other options here
      ],
    ),
```

Please add options in the order that you want to display them.

The built-in options that you can add are:

1. ToggleSpeakerphoneOption
2. ToggleMicrophoneOption
3. ToggleCameraOption
4. FlipCameraOption
5. LeaveCallOption

### Customising visual properties

When using `StreamCallControls`, you can control the spacing between the elements as well as the elevation,
padding, and `BorderRadius` of the widget. You can use the `spacing`, `elevation`, `padding`, and `borderRadius`
properties for this respectively.

As an example, if we wanted to create a `StreamCallControls` widget with a spacing of 14.0 between elements,
and a borderRadius of 16.0, the code would look like:

```dart
    StreamCallControls(
      options: [
        // Custom action
        CallControlOption(
          icon: const Icon(Icons.chat_outlined),
          onPressed: () async {},
        ),
        // Add other options here
      ],
      spacing: 14,
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(16),
    ),
```

The visual properties mentioned in this section apply to both constructors of the widget.
