# CallParticipant

The `CallParticipant` widget represents a single participant in a call and displays various things such
as the video track of the participant, the connection quality of the user, whether the user is speaking,
if the user is muted, and more.

## Usage

To use the `CallParticipant` widget, you need to provide the call as well as the state of the participant
to display.

```dart
    StreamCallParticipant(
      call: call,
      participant: participant,
    ),
```

## Customisation

The `CallParticipant` widget has quite a few parameters that allow you to customise the widget since
the widget is relatively complex. The full widget contains the video, the name of the user, an indicator
if the user is speaking, an icon for the user muted status, and more.
