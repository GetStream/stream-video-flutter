Similar to Flutterâ€™s out-of-the-box `Container` widget, `StreamCallContainer` serves as a convenient widget for handling everything related to video and calling.

By default, `StreamCallContainer` subscribes to a given `call` and listens for state changes during the call's life cycle.

When the user receives an incoming `ringing` call, the widget automatically updates its UI to display a ringing screen. During the call lifecycle, the widget will also update itself to show call screen and outgoing call screen depending on the actions taken by the user.

### Customizing Call Container

```dart
const StreamCallContainer({
    super.key,
    required this.call,
    this.callConnectOptions = const CallConnectOptions(),
    this.onBackPressed,
    this.onLeaveCallTap,
    this.onAcceptCallTap,
    this.onDeclineCallTap,
    this.onCancelCallTap,
    this.incomingCallBuilder,
    this.outgoingCallBuilder,
    this.callContentBuilder,
  });
```

Developers can easily respond to user actions, such as accepting or declining a call, by using exposed callbacks and builders.

To replace default screens, such as those displayed when an incoming call is detected, developers can use one of the many optional builders available.

```dart
@override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   return Scaffold(
    body: StreamCallContainer(
      call: widget.call,
      incomingCallBuilder: (context, call, callState) {
        return CustomIncomingCallScreen(call: call, state: callState);
      },
    ),
);
```

All `builders` exposed by `StreamCallContainer` provide users with an ongoing `Call` object and the associated `CallState`. You can use these to subscribe to changes and display different UI options depending on the events.

If your use case does not require ringing, incoming, or outgoing capabilities like Google Meet, then our `CallScreen` widget may be a better option. Keep reading to learn how to use it in your application.
