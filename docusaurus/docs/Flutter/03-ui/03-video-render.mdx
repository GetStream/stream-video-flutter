One of the primary low-level widgets we offer is `StreamVideoRenderer`. As the name suggests, this widget is specifically designed to render the video track of a call participant. It also exposes callbacks that can be utilized to handle sizing changes, placeholder content, and other related functionalities.

However, since `StreamVideoRenderer` is relatively basic, we have also introduced `StreamCallParticipant` as an extended version. It adds several extra features on top of `StreamVideoRenderer`, such as connection quality indicators, microphone indicators, and more.

Since the SDK is designed to be modular and customizable, developers can choose whether they want to use the raw renderer or the participant widget.

When in doubt, we recommend starting with `StreamCallParticipant` unless there is an explicit reason not to.

### Customizing `StreamCallParticipant`

```dart
const StreamCallParticipant({
    super.key,
    required this.call,
    required this.participant,
    this.backgroundColor,
    this.borderRadius,
    this.userAvatarTheme,
    this.showSpeakerBorder,
    this.speakerBorderThickness,
    this.speakerBorderColor,
    this.showParticipantLabel,
    this.participantLabelTextStyle,
    this.participantLabelAlignment,
    this.audioLevelIndicatorColor,
    this.enabledMicrophoneColor,
    this.disabledMicrophoneColor,
    this.showConnectionQualityIndicator,
    this.connectionLevelActiveColor,
    this.connectionLevelInactiveColor,
    this.connectionLevelAlignment,
    this.videoPlaceholderBuilder,
    this.videoRendererBuilder,
    this.onSizeChanged,
  });
```

Call Participant allows you to customize everything from the background color and border radius to setting placeholder content and customizing the audio level indicators.

To use the widget, you need to supply two arguments: the current `call` and `participant` to render. Both of these parameters can be fetched from either `activeCall` or `callState`.

```dart
StreamCallContent(
    call: call,
    callState: callState,
    callParticipantsBuilder: (context, call, callState) {
      return StreamCallParticipant(
        call: call,
        participant: callState.localParticipant!,
      );
    },
  );
```

### Using `StreamVideoRenderer` directly:

```dart
StreamCallContent(
    call: call,
    callState: callState,
    callParticipantsBuilder: (context, call, callState) {
      return StreamVideoRenderer(
        call: call,
        participant: callState.localParticipant!,
        videoTrackType: SfuTrackType.screenShare,
        videoFit: VideoFit.contain,
      );
    },
  );
```

Video Render is the lowest level for displaying a participant's video in Flutter. Unlike `StreamCallParticipant`, the options exposed by `StreamVideoRenderer` are minimal and focuses more on video fit and layout, determining which track types to display, and providing callbacks for handling changes to the video rendering.

Both `StreamVideoRenderer` and `StreamCallParticipant` can be used as part of other components, such as `StreamCallContent`, or as standalone widgets in your application, as long as the `call` and `participant` parameters are supplied.
