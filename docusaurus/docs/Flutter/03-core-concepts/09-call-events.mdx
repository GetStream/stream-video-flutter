There are multiple events that you can listen to during a call. You can use them to update the UI, show notifications, or log the call events. You can listen to them via `callEvents` stream in the `Call` object.

Here are some of the events you can listen to:


| Call Event                                    | Description                                           |

## Custom event

Stream Video also supports custom events. This is a real-time layer that you can broadcast your own events to.

### Sending custom events

You can use the `sendCustomEvent` method of the `Call` instance to send custom events:

```dart
call.sendCustomEvent(
    eventType: 'my-custom-event',
    custom: {
      'key': 'value',
    },
);
```

### Receiving custom events
â€‹
You can listen to custom events by listening to the `StreamCallCustomEvent` event via the same `callEvents` stream:

```dart
call.callEvents.on<StreamCallCustomEvent>((event) { });
```
