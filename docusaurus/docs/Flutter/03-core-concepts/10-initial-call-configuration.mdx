description: How to configure the initial call setup
---

There are two ways to configure the initial call setup:
* Using the Stream Dashboard to setup the initial configuration per call type
* Passing the initial configuration in by `CallConnectOptions` parameter

### Stream Dashboard

You can configure the initial call setup using the Stream Dashboard. This is useful when you want to set up the initial configuration for a specific call type.
Find the call type you want to configure on the list of call types: https://dashboard.getstream.io/app/{YOUR-APP-ID}/video/call-types. Then under Video, Audio and Advanced settings sections you can set things like:

* Turn camera on/off by default
* Turn microphone on/off by default
* Set default camera facing
* Set default audio output device

### CallConnectOptions parameter
​
Using the `CallConnectOptions` class you can configure the initial call setup programmatically. It provides the following options:

* Enabling or disabling the camera
* Enabling or disabling the microphone
* Enabling or disabling the screen sharing
* Setting the camera facing mode
* Setting the audio output device
* Setting the audio input device

You can provide this class as a parameter when joining a call:

```dart
  final call = client.makeCall(callType: StreamCallType(), id: '345');
  await call.join(connectOptions: connectOptions);
```

Or by passing it to the `StreamCallContainer` widget

```dart
StreamCallContainer(
          call: widget.call,
          callConnectOptions: connectOptions,
          ...
);
```

You can access current options by calling `call.connectOptions` on the `Call` object.

```dart
  final call = client.makeCall(callType: StreamCallType(), id: '345');
  await call.getOrCreate(connectOptions: connectOptions);
  final callOptions = call.connectOptions;
```

:::note
  When `getOrCreate` method is called, the default options will be created based on the Stream Dashboard settings.
  You can then leverage the `call.connectOptions` to modify the default settings and pass them to the `join` method at the end.
