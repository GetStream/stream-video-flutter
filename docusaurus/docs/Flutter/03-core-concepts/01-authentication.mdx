### Client Overview

`StreamVideo` is the main class used for creating class, performing authentication and listening to core events dispatched by Streamâ€™s servers.

Before users are able to join or create a call, the client must first be configured with an `apiKey` obtained from the Stream Dashboard for the given project.

The initialization constructor for `StreamVideo` also exposes many customization options which can be overridden based on the project needs such as the logging level, SDP policy, retry policy, etc.

```dart
static StreamVideo init(
    String apiKey, {
    LatencySettings latencySettings = const LatencySettings(),
    RetryPolicy retryPolicy = const RetryPolicy(),
    SdpPolicy sdpPolicy = _defaultSdpPolicy,
    Priority logPriority = Priority.none,
    LogHandlerFunction logHandlerFunction = _defaultLogHandler,
  })
```

### Working with Tokens

All tokens must be generated via a backend SDK and cannot be created from a frontend client. This step is typically included whenever a new user is registered on your backend.

There are a few ways in which users can connect using our SDK. We support both long lived tokens and dynamic tokens via two constructors accessible on the `StreamVideo` class:

- `connectUser(UserInfo user, String token)`
- `connectUserWithProvider(user, tokenProvider)`

For situations where your backend does not require tokens to be refreshed, `connectUser` can be used by simply passing in a `UserInfo` object and the token as a `String`.

*Dynamic tokens*

Using `connectUserWithProvider`, a Token Provider can be used to dynamically load a token from a server. On expiration, the SDK automatically calls the Token Provider to obtain a new token.

As long as your handler returns a `String` it will satisfy the contract of `TokenProvider`

```dart
Future<String> _tokenLoader(String userId) async {
    final token = await backend.loadToken(
      apiKey: Env.apiKey,
      userId: userId,
    );
    return token;
  }
```

```dart
await streamVideo.connectUserWithProvider(
      user,
      tokenProvider: TokenProvider.dynamic(_tokenLoader, (token) async {
				// Callback function with the token
      }),
    );
```

### Anonymous users

For use-cases like live streaming or guest meeting, you may want to allow users to join a call without creating an account.

For these use-cases, the SDK has a guest endpoint which can be used to create a temporary user

```dart
final guest = await streamVideo.createGuest(
      id: guestId,
      name: guestId,
      image: imageUrl,
    );
    final data = guest.getDataOrNull();
    if (data == null) {
      throw Exception();
    }

    final userInfo = UserInfo(
      id: data.user.id,
      image: data.user.image,
      name: data.user.name ?? '',
      teams: data.user.teams ?? [],
      role: data.user.role,
    );

    await streamVideo.connectUser(userInfo, data.accessToken);
```

`createGuest` returns user information and a token which can be used to construct information about the user and connect to the API.
