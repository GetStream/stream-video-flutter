import { TokenSnippet } from '../../../shared/_tokenSnippet.jsx';

Before joining a call, it is necessary to set up the video client. Here's a basic example:

```dart
final client = StreamVideo(
  'REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY',
  user: User.regular(
    userId: 'REPLACE_WITH_USER_ID',
    name: 'John Doe',
  ),
  userToken: 'REPLACE_WITH_TOKEN',
);
```

* The API Key can be found in your Stream dashboard.
* The User can be either authenticated, anonymous or guest.
* Note: You can store custom data on the user object, if required.

`StreamVideo` is the main class used for creating class, performing authentication and listening to core events dispatched by Stream’s servers.
The initialization constructor for `StreamVideo` also exposes many customization options which can be overridden based on the project needs such as the logging level, SDP policy, retry policy, etc.

```dart
factory StreamVideo(
  String apiKey, {
  StreamVideoOptions options = StreamVideoOptions(
    coordinatorRpcUrl: _defaultCoordinatorRpcUrl,
    coordinatorWsUrl: _defaultCoordinatorWsUrl,
    latencySettings: const LatencySettings(),
    sdpPolicy: const SdpPolicy(),
    retryPolicy: const RetryPolicy(),
    logPriority: Priority.none,
    logHandlerFunction: _defaultLogHandler,
    muteVideoWhenInBackground: false,
    muteAudioWhenInBackground: false,
    autoConnect: true,
    includeUserDetailsForAutoConnect: true,
    keepConnectionsAliveWhenInBackground: false,
  ),
  required User user,
  String? userToken,
  TokenLoader? tokenLoader,
  OnTokenUpdated? onTokenUpdated,
  bool failIfSingletonExists = true,
  PNManagerProvider? pushNotificationManagerProvider,
});
```
:::note
The SDK tries to connect to Stream's backend automatically by default. You can set `autoConnect` to false in `StreamVideoOptions`
to change this behaviour.
:::

If you choose to connect later, you can use the `connect()` method to connect to Stream Video:

```dart
    StreamVideo.instance.connect();
```

The connection passes the user info by default to the backend.
To change this, you can set the `includeUserDetailsForAutoConnect` parameter in `StreamVideoOptions` when auto-connecting
or use the `includeUserDetails` parameter when using the `connect()` method:

```dart
    StreamVideo.instance.connect(
        includeUserDetails: false,
    );
```

### Working with Tokens

All tokens must be generated via a backend SDK and cannot be created from a frontend client. This step is typically included whenever a new user is registered on your backend.

Here's a valid user and token to help you get started on the client side, before integrating with your backend API.

<TokenSnippet sampleApp='meeting' displayStyle='credentials'/>

There are a few ways in which users can connect using our SDK.
We support both long lived tokens and dynamic tokens via two parameters accessible on the `StreamVideo` class:

- `StreamVideo(apiKey, user: User, userToken: String)`
- `StreamVideo(apiKey, user: User, tokenLoader: TokenLoader)`

For situations where your backend does not require tokens to be refreshed, the first variant of the two above can be used by simply passing in a `User` object and the `userToken` as a `String`.

Using the second variant, a Token Loader can be used to dynamically load a token from a server. On expiration, the SDK automatically calls the Token Loader to obtain a new token.

As long as your handler returns a `String` it will satisfy the contract of `TokenLoader`.
Here is an example of how you could write the token loader logic in your app:

```dart
Future<String> _tokenLoader(String userId) async {
  final token = await backend.loadToken(
    apiKey: Env.apiKey,
    userId: userId,
  );
  return token;
}
```

```dart
StreamVideo(
  apiKey, 
  user: user, 
  tokenLoader: _tokenLoader,
  onTokenUpdated: (token) async {
    // Callback function with the token.
    // Called when the token is updated.
  },
);
```

### Anonymous / Guest users

For use-cases like live streaming or guest meeting, you may want to allow users to join a call without creating an account.

For these use-cases, the SDK has a guest endpoint which can be used to create a temporary user

```dart
final guest = User.guest(userId: guestId, name: guestName, image: guestImage);
final client = StreamVideo(
  apiKey,
  user: guest,
);

final result = await client.connect();
// if result wasn't successful, then result will return null
final userToken = result.getDataOrNull();
final userInfo = client.currentUser;
```
:::note
`userInfo.id` will be slightly different from what you passed in. This is because the SDK will generate a unique ID for the user.
Please user the generated ID across your app.
