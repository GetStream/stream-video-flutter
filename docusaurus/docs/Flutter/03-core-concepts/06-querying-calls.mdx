title: Querying Calls
---

For many different use cases, such as video calls, livestreams, or audio rooms, you may want to search and filter calls based on different criteria, such as:

- Upcoming calls
- Calls that are currently live
- Popular livestreams or audio rooms with a link to the recording.

To facilitate these, the SDK provides methods which allows users to quickly perform sorting and filtering using the `queryCalls` method on `StreamVideo`.

### Filtering

To filter calls, a map containing the fields and conditions must be supplied to `queryCalls` via the `filterConditions` parameter.

```dart
final result = await video.queryCalls(
  filterConditions: {
    "custom.flutterAudioRoomCall": true,
  },
);
```

In the above example, we filter all calls that contain the custom field `flutterAudioRoomCall`. Other filtering options include call type, members, and start times.

For instance, to find all livestreams on our application, we can set the `type` filter to `livestream`.

```dart
final result = await video.queryCalls(
  filterConditions: {
    "type": 'livestream',
  },
);
```

Filter expressions support multiple matching criteria, and it is also possible to combine filters. For more information, please visit the [filter operators guide](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/ios-swift/query_syntax_operators/?language=swift&q=filter). The full list of options that you can filter by is listed in the table below.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| type | The call type. Typically default, livestream etc |
| id | The id for this call |
| cid | The cid for this call. IE default:123 |
| created_by_user_id | The user id who created the call |
| created_at | When the call was created |
| updated_at | When the call was updated |
| starts_at | When the call starts at |
| ended_at | When the call ended |
| backstage | If the call is in backstage mode or not |
| members | Check if you are a member of this call |
| custom | You can query custom data using the "custom.myfield" syntax |

### Sorting

Similar to filtering, the SDK offers robust support for sorting, enabling sorting on the following fields:

- `starts_at`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`
- `ended_at`
- `type`
- `id`
- `cid`

To add a sort, it is simple as specifying a list of sorts to the `queryCalls` function:

```dart
final result = await video.queryCalls(
  sorts: [
    SortParamRequest(field: 'starts_at', direction: -1),
  ],
);
```

The `queryCalls` function can take multiple sort parameters, which can be combined with filtering to give you powerful control over the data in your application.
