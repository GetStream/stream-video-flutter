title: Call and Participant State
---

When a `Call` is created, users can subscribe to receive notifications about any changes that may occur during the call's lifecycle.

To access the state of a call, use `call.state.value` to obtain the latest `CallState` snapshot, or use `valueStream` to listen for real-time changes to the `CallState`.

This functionality is particularly useful for determining which parts of the UI or application to render based on the current state or lifecycle of the ongoing call. For example, you may want to display an indicator to users when a call is being recorded.

```dart
StreamBuilder<CallState>(
  stream: call.state.valueStream, // Subscribe to state changes
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    final state = snapshot.data;
    if (state.isRecording) {
      return CallRecordingUI();
    } else {
      return RegularCallUI();
    }
  },
),
```

## Understanding Call Status

The `CallStatus` property of the `CallState` object indicates the current state of the call. Depending on where you are in the call lifecycle, `CallStatus` can have one of the following possible values.

| Call Status            | Description                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CallStatusIdle         | Indicates that there is no active call at the moment.                                                                                  |
| CallStatusIncoming     | Indicates that thereâ€™s an incoming call, and you need to display an incoming call screen.                                              |
| CallStatusOutgoing     | Indicates that the user is making an outgoing call, and you need to display an outgoing call screen.                                   |
| CallStatusConnecting   |                                                                                                                                        |
| CallStatusReconnecting | Indicates that the SDK is attempting to reconnect to the call. The number of attempts can be set via the attempt property.             |
| CallStatusConnected    | Indicates that the user is connected to the call and is ready to send and receive tracks.                                              |
| CallStatusDisconnected | Indicates that the call has ended, failed, or has been canceled. The exact reason can be accessed via the DisconnectedReason property. |
| CallStatusJoining      |                                                                                                                                        |
| CallStatusJoined       | Indicates that the user has successfully joined the call.                                                                              |

By checking the `CallStatus` value in the `CallState` object, you can determine the current state of the call and adjust your UI accordingly.

### Participant State

In the call state, you can find the parameter `callParticipants`. This parameter allows you to access and manipulate the participants present on the call. By using `callParticipants`, you can easily map over the participants and observe changes in their configuration.

For instance, you can keep track of which participant is currently speaking, which participant is the dominant speaker, and which participant is pinned to the call. Additionally, `callParticipants` allows you to monitor other changes to the call's configuration as well.

Overall, `callParticipants` is a powerful tool that provides you with a lot of control and insight into the call's current state and configuration. By leveraging this parameter effectively, you can create more advanced and robust call applications.

- User Id
- Role
- Name
- Image
- Session Id
- TrackId Prefix
- PublishedTracks
- Is Local
- Connection Quality
- Is Online
- Audio Level
- Is Speaking
- Is Dominant Speaker
- Is Pinned
- Reaction
- Viewport Visibility

```dart
for(final user in call.state.value.callParticipants){
	if(user.isdominantSpeaker){
		setState(()=> dominantSpeaker = user);
	}
}
```

Combining `CallState` and `CallParticipantState` makes building custom UIs and integrations a breeze. If there is a property or API that is not exposed for your specific use case, feel free to reach out to us. We are constantly iterating and exposing APIs based on your feedback.
