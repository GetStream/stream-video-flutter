## Reactions
â€‹
It's easy to add reactions to your call.

```dart
await call.sendReaction(reactionType: 'fireworks');
```

You can also add custom data to the reaction and specify a specific emoji

```dart
await call.sendReaction(
        reactionType: 'raise-hand',
        emojiCode: ':smile:',
        custom: {'mycustomfield': 'mycustomvalue'},
    );
```

Refer to the [cookbook](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/ui-cookbook/reactions/) for information on built-in reaction components and customization.
