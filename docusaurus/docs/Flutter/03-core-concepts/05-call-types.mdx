When you create a call like this

```dart
final call = client.makeCall(callType: StreamCallType(), "123")
```

You create a call of the type `default` with id `123`.

There are 4 built-in call types, `default`, `audio_room`, `livestream` and `development`.

You can also create your own types by calling `StreamCallType.custom`.
  
```dart
final call = client.makeCall(callType: StreamCallType.custom("custom"), "123")
```

:::note
  When using a custom call type, you need to make sure that the server is configured to handle the custom call type.
  Also the `StreamCallType.custom` is lenient and will create a `StreamCallType` even if you misspell it.
