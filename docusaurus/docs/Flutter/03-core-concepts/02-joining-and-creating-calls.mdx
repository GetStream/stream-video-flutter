title: Joining and Creating Calls
---

With authentication out of the way, we can now focus on creating and joining calls. Before proceeding, we highly recommend that you read the previous section on authentication, as the two are closely related.

### Creating Calls

To create a call, we first call the `makeCall` function on the `StreamVideo` class and pass it the call type and ID. The most common call type is `default`, which enables full audio and video transmission. However, as we will learn later, there are multiple call types (and even custom types) from which you can choose based on your use case.

```dart
final call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(type: 'default', id: 'Your-call-ID');

```

Calling `makeCall` returns a `Call` object for us to work with. However, it does neither connect nor start transmitting data automatically. To create and join the call, we must then invoke `getOrCreate` on the returned object.

```dart
final call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(type: 'default', id: 'Your-call-ID');
await call.getOrCreate(); // New

```

Although we are not passing any parameters to `getOrCreate` in the above example, it is important to note a few things:

1. Participants: Upon creation, we can supply a list of user IDs we would like to immediately add to the call.
2. Ringing: If ringing is set to `true`, Stream will send a notification to the users on the call, triggering the platform call screen on iOS and Android.

By default, calling `getOrCreate` assigns `admin` permission to each user who is supplied during creation.

### Call CRUD Operations

With calls, we make it easy to perform basic create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on calls providing the user has sufficient permissions.

For example, once a call is created a user can `call.update` the information on the call by adding custom metadata such as a name, description, or any other arbitrary `Map<String, Object>` to the call before `getOrCreate` is invoked.

```dart
call.update(custom: {'name': 'My first Call'});
await call.getOrCreate();
```

Using the update method, a variety of settings can also be applied before the call is created such as:

- Ring
- Audio
- Video
- ScreenShare
- Recording
- Transcription
- Backstage
- Geofencing

### Joining Calls

To join a call that already exists, you must first know two things:

- The `callType` of the existing call
- The `ID` of the existing call

Similar to the flow of creating a call, we can use `makeCall` to construct a `Call` class for us to perform operations on.

```dart
final call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(type: 'default', id: 'My-existing-call-ID');

```

Next, with our class instantiated, we can connect to the call and SFU by invoking `connect`.

```dart
final call = StreamVideo.instance.makeCall(type: 'default', id: 'My-existing-call-ID');
await call.join();

```

Unlike the call creation flow and functions, the user must have sufficient permissions to join the call or a `VideoError` will be returned. All users connected via the `join()` function have the permission type of `user` by default and are limited in the actions they can perform.

That's it. In just a few lines, we have created our first calls, and they are ready for the world to join. To learn how to observe events and the state of a call, please read the next chapter.
