There are two sources of statistics you can use to monitor the performance of your calls:
- `Call.stats` stream that provides real-time webRTC statistics
- `CallState` properties that contain some of the webRTC statistics processed and more useful for display purposes

## Stats stream

If you want to tap in directly into the stream of webRTC stats you can do this with `stats` steam inside `Call` object. It provides a stream of [`CallStats`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-flutter/blob/main/packages/stream_video/lib/src/models/call_stats.dart) objects for publisher and subscriber connections.
We provide those statistics in three ways for ease of use:

* `raw` - raw stats as they come from the webRTC
* `printable` - representation of the stats that can be easily printed to the console or as a block of text
* `stats` - webRTC stats but in a structured form

## CallState properties

You can also access more processed data with useful information about the call. This data is available in [`CallState`](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-flutter/blob/main/packages/stream_video/lib/src/call_state.dart) object. Here are some of the properties that you can use:

`publisherStats` and `subscriberStats` - objects that contain the following data:
* `latency` - the time it takes to deliver the data between the server and the app
* `jitterInMs` -  the variation in the delay of receiving packets of data over a network
* `bitrateKbps` - the rate at which data is transmitted from the app to the server (publisher) or from the server to the app (subscriber)

`localStats` - object that contain the following data:
* `sfu` - the server we are connected to
* `sdkVersion` - the version of the Stream SDK
* `webRtcVersion` - the version of the webRTC

`latencyHistory` - array of latency values for the last 10 seconds

## Example usage

You can check the example of the stats screen in our [demo app](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-video-flutter/blob/main/dogfooding/lib/screens/call_stats_screen.dart)
