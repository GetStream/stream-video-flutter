Permissions for a video call can be complex, particularly for use cases like educational apps, live events, audio rooms, and live streams. These use cases require detailed permissions to ensure proper functionality and user privacy.

### Current Permissions

To check if a user has certain permissions, such as transmitting audio, video, or screen sharing, you can use the `hasPermission` method on the `Call` class:

```
final canScreenShare = call.hasPermission(CallPermission.screenshare);

```

### Requesting and Granting Permissions

If a user does not have permission for an action, it can be requested by calling `requestPermissions` on the current `Call` object.

This method accepts a list of `CallPermission` allowing for multiple permission requests to be batched into a single call:

```dart
call.requestPermissions([CallPermission.screenshare, CallPermission.sendVideo]);
```

As a call admin, you can grant permission to other users by calling `call.grantPermissions` along with the userâ€™s `id` and the list of permissions you would like to grant:

```dart
call.grantPermissions(userId: 'nash', [CallPermission.screenshare, CallPermission.sendVideo])

```

During a call, it is advised to set up a handler to listen and react to permission requests as they arrive. This can be done by passing a callback function to the `onPermissionRequest` property present on the `Call` object:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  widget.call.onPermissionRequest = (CoordinatorCallPermissionRequestEvent request) {
    // TODO Handle Permission requests

  };
}
```

The `CoordinatorCallPermissionRequestEvent` includes the following attributes which can be used to either grant or reject permission requests:

- Call Cid
- Created At
- Permissions
- User

### Moderation Capabilities

As with all calls, there may be times when user permissions need to be revoked, or the user needs to be banned, muted, or subjected to other actions to limit their interaction.

To facilitate these requests, the SDK provides several methods for limiting user interaction during the call lifecycle.

**Revoke Permissions**

Similar to its sister method `grantPermissions`, the `revokePermissions` method exists on the current `Call` object. It enables users to easily remove permissions assigned to a specific user by providing their user ID and the list of permissions to be revoked..

```dart
call.revokePermissions(userId: 'nash', [CallPermission.screenshare, CallPermission.sendVideo]);

```

**Mute Users**

To disable the audio tracks of all users on a call or a specific user in a call, the `muteOthers` and `muteUser` functions can be called, respectively.

```dart
call.muteAllUsers();
```

```dart

call.muteUsers(userIds: ['thierry']);
```

:::tip

In the above example, we are only muting a single user. However, `muteUsers` does allow us to mute multiple users since it accepts a list of user IDs.

:::

**Blocking Members**

Blocking and unblocking users can be done by calling `blockUser` or `unblockUser` on the current `Call` object.

```dart

call.blockUser('deven');

call.unblockUser('deven');
```

**Ending the Call**

As a host, you are able to end the current call for everyone using the `call.end` method.

```dart
await call.end();
```

To silently leave a call, the `disconnect` method can be used in place of the `end` method.
