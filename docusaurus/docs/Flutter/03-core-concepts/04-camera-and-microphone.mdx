Working with hardware devices can always have some level of complexity to it but the SDK does a lot to abstract the complexities and expose an intuitive interface for querying the connected devices and changing them throughout the call.

:::note
  As a reminder, before attempting to access the user’s connected devices,
  please ensure the appropriate permissions are set in both the iOS `plist` file
  and Android Manifest.

### Camera Operations

Conveniently attached to the `Call` class are a series of methods which can be used to flip the device’s camera, set the camera position, and disable the camera all together.

```dart
call.flipCamera();
call.setCameraPosition(CameraPosition.front);
call.setCameraEnabled(enabled: false);
```

You can fetch the current camera via the call state:

 ```dart
 var camera = call.state.value.videoInputDevice;
 ```

### Audio Operations

Similar the Camera API, the `Call` object also includes methods for performing audio actions like disabling the audio devices, configuring the audio input device and audio output device.

```dart
call.setAudioInputDevice(device);
call.setAudioOutputDevice(device);
call.setMicrophoneEnabled(enabled: true);
```

You can fetch the current input and output device via the call state:

```dart
var microphone = call.state.value.audioInputDevice;
var speaker = call.state.value.audioOutputDevice;
```

### Listing Connected Devices

There may be cases where it becomes necessary to query all of the connected devices or listen to hardware changes such as when the user connects a new microphone or camera to their machine.

For this, the `RtcMediaDeviceNotifier` can be used. Encapsulated in this class are methods and listeners for interacting with all connected devices.

```dart
RtcMediaDeviceNotifier.instance.onDeviceChange.listen((devices) {
  final audioInputDevice = devices.where((device) => device.kind == RtcMediaDeviceKind.audioInput);
  call.setAudioInputDevice(audioInputDevice.first);
});
```

When you need to fetch the list of video and audio devices available on the device, you can use the `RtcMediaDeviceNotifier` class:

```dart
final videoDevices = RtcMediaDeviceNotifier.instance.audioOutputs();
final outputDevices = RtcMediaDeviceNotifier.instance.audioInputs();
final inputDevices = RtcMediaDeviceNotifier.instance.videoInputs();
```

When it comes to audio devices, WebRTC classifies them as two types, `Earpiece` and `Speaker`. These can be used to sort and further filter the devices connected to your app.
