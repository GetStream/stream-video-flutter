üîÑ Changed
* `Call.reject()` method will now always call `Call.leave()` method internally.

üöß Breaking changes
* Removed the deprecated `Call.joinLobby()` method.

* Added support for `targetResolution` setting set on the Dashboard to determine the max resolution the video stream.
* Introduced new API methods to give greater control over incoming video quality. `Call.setPreferredIncomingVideoResolution()` allows you to manually set a preferred video resolution, while `Call.setIncomingVideoEnabled()` enables or disables incoming video. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/manual-video-quality-selection/).
