## 0.6.0

This release introduces a major rework of the join/reconnect flow in the Call class to support Reconnect V2, enhancing reconnection handling across various scenarios. Most updates are within the internals of the Call class, though some changes are outward-facing, including a few breaking changes.

🔄 Changed
* `Call.reject()` method will now always call `Call.leave()` method internally.

🚧 Breaking changes
* Removed the deprecated `Call.joinLobby()` method.
* The `maxDuration` and `maxParticipants` parameters of `Call.getOrCreate()` are now combined into the `StreamLimitsSettings? limits` parameter.

🔄 Dependency updates
* Updated Firebase dependencies to resolve Xcode 16 build issues.

✅ Added
* Added the `registerPushDevice` optional parameter (default is `true`) to the `StreamVideo.connect()` method,allowing the prevention of automatic push token registration.
* Added `participantCount` and `anonymousParticipantCount` to `CallState` reflecting the current number of participants in the call.
* Introduced the `watch` parameter to `Call.get()` and `Call.getOrCreate()` methods (default is `true`). When set to `true`, this enables the `Call` to listen for coordinator events and update its state accordingly, even before the call is joined (`Call.join()`).
* Added support for `targetResolution` setting set on the Dashboard to determine the max resolution the video stream.
* Introduced new API methods to give greater control over incoming video quality. `Call.setPreferredIncomingVideoResolution()` allows you to manually set a preferred video resolution, while `Call.setIncomingVideoEnabled()` enables or disables incoming video. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/manual-video-quality-selection/).

🐞 Fixed
* Automatic push token registration by `StreamVideo` now stores registered token in `SharedPreferences`, performing an API call only when the token changes.
* Fixed premature ringing termination issues.
* Resolved issues where ringing would not end when the caller terminates the call in an app-terminated state.
* Fixed issue with call not ending in some cases when only one participant is left and `dropIfAloneInRingingFlow` is set to `true`.

## 0.5.5

🐞 Fixed
* Migrated from `internet_connection_checker` to `internet_connection_checker_plus` due to [license issues](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/09/2024-09-04-internet-connection-checker-plus.md)

## 0.5.4

🐞 Fixed
* Fixed an issue where active call foreground service was recreated after being stopped when ringing call was declined and in-app incoming screen was displayed.

🚧 Breaking changes
* The regular push notification handling has been removed from iOS, providing more control over the implementation. VoIP push notifications will continue to be handled as before. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/push-notifications/).

* Dependency updates
    * Flutter SDK constraint updated to >=3.22.0 (Dart SDK to >=3.4.0 <4.0.0)
    * `internet_connection_checker` updated from ^1.0.0+1 to ^2.0.0
    * `rxdart` updated from ^0.27.7 to ^0.28.0
    * `web` updated from ^0.5.1 to ^1.0.0
    * `web_socket_channel` updated from ^2.4.0 to ^3.0.1

## 0.5.3

🐞 Fixed
* Improved video quality for a smoother experience.
* Resolved an issue where the participant's state showed an empty roles list.
* Fixed a bug that caused the CallKit ringing notification to continue after a call was accepted.

## 0.5.2

🔄 Changed
* `SortParam` changed to `SortParamRequest` in `queryMembers()` method inside `Call` and `StreamVideo` class

## 0.5.1

✅ Added
* Added `backstage` parameter to `call.getOtCreate()` method with backstage settings. For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/joining-and-creating-calls/#backstage-setup)
    * Ability to join call in advance with `joinAheadTimeSeconds` parameter (part of `StreamBackstageSettings`)
* Added `startsAt` parameter to `call.getOtCreate()` method
* Added `maxDuration` and `maxParticipants` parameters to `call.getOtCreate()` method
* Added `video` parameter to `call.getOtCreate()`, `call.getCall()` and `call.join()` methods. This parameter is used to distinguish between audio-only and video calls for ringing purposes.
    * ❗Important❗ the `video` parameter is `false` by default. If you want your call to be treated as a video call while ringing set it to `true`.

🐞 Fixed
* Fixed reaction dismissal: Sent and received reactions are now correctly dismissed after a 5-second timeout (configurable in `CallPreferences`).
* Fixed the cancel button behavior in the screen-sharing notification on Android. It will now correctly stop the screen-sharing process.
* Fixed the issue with the cancel button in the call-in-progress notification was not stopping the call.
* Fixed the connection quality updates for other call participants.
* Fixed an issue where declining a ringing call when the app was in a terminated state did not stop the ringing on the caller's end.

## 0.5.0

✅ Added
* Picture in Picture (PiP) is now also supported on iOS. For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/advanced/picture_in_picture/)

🐞 Fixed
* Fixed an issue where the microphone was being muted when the app was running in the background on Android versions greater than 14.

🚧 Breaking changes
* The implementation of `BroadcastSampleHandler`, used for `broadcast` screen-sharing mode on iOS is now moved from `stream_video_flutter` package to a separate [stream_video_screen_sharing](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_video_screen_sharing) package.
Migration steps:
- Add `stream_video_screen_sharing` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file
- Replace the import in `SampleHandler.swift` file from `stream_video_flutter` to `stream_video_screen_sharing`
- Replace the dependancy added to the extension target in `Podfile` file from `stream_video_flutter` to `stream_video_screen_sharing`

For complete screen-sharing guide please refer to the [documentaiton](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/advanced/screen_sharing/)

* Previously deprecated `String` `type` parameters in `makeCall()` and `getCallRingingState()` methods are now removed. Use `StreamCallType` `callType` parameter now.
* Previously deprecated `events` and `coordinatorEvents` streams are now removed from `Call` class. Use `callEvents` instead.

## 0.4.4

* Introduced `listRecordings()` to `StreamVideo` object, enabling you to query call recordings using a provided call CID.

🔄 Changed
* The default constructor for `StreamCallType` is now deprecated. Instead, use the `StreamCallType.defaultType()` factory constuctor.

* Changed `SortParamRequest` to `SortParam`.

🔄 Changed some of the signatures
