## Upcoming

✅ Added
* Added `backstage` parameter to `call.getOtCreate()` method with backstage settings. For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/joining-and-creating-calls/#backstage-setup)
    * Ability to join call in advance with `joinAheadTimeSeconds` parameter (part of `StreamBackstageSettings`)

* Added `maxDuration` and `maxParticipants` parameters to `call.getOtCreate()` method
* Added `video` parameter to `call.getOtCreate()`, `call.getCall()` and `call.join()` methods. This parameter is used to distinguish between audio-only and video calls for ringing purposes.
    * ❗Important❗ the `video` parameter is `false` by default. If you want your call to be treated as a video call while ringing set it to `true`.

🐞 Fixed
* Fixed reaction dismissal. Sent and received reactions are now correctly dismissed after 5s timeout (configurable in `CallPreferences`).

🐞 Fixed
* Fixed an issue where the microphone was being muted when the app was running in the background on Android versions greater than 14.

🚧 Breaking changes
* The implementation of `BroadcastSampleHandler`, used for `broadcast` screen-sharing mode on iOS is now moved from `stream_video_flutter` package to a separate [stream_video_screen_sharing](https://pub.dev/packages/stream_video_screen_sharing) package.
Migration steps:
- Add `stream_video_screen_sharing` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file
- Replace the import in `SampleHandler.swift` file from `stream_video_flutter` to `stream_video_screen_sharing`
- Replace the dependancy added to the extension target in `Podfile` file from `stream_video_flutter` to `stream_video_screen_sharing`

For complete screen-sharing guide please refer to the [documentaiton](https://getstream.io/video/docs/flutter/advanced/screen_sharing/)
